Modifications to Docsy are done to align with VMware's open source theme and not to misapropriate the hard work that goes into Docsy.

In that spirit, the following high-level changes have been made:

- Moodified README.md to say 'vHomelander' instead of 'Docsy'
- Renamed 'userguide' to 'example-lander-site' and updated content for VMware specific open source projects
- addition of CSS classes and files to match vmware open source template
    - base.scss
    - components.scss
    - header.scss
    - footer.scss
- Removed netlify deployment docs
- changed default icons
- switched to Metropolis font family
- updated theme.toml
